Initial project with HTML, CSS and a little JS! Very clean application, with essential, clear and direct information, but including the very important responsiveness - with mobile first, redirection to other relevant pages through icons at the bottom of the screen and the Web Developer's avatar (with a light CSS animation on hover ) and accessibility for screen reader programs.
